As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nCode of Conduct\nQuestion or Problem?\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\nContributing to Community\n\n Code of Conduct\nHelp us keep Angular open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.\n Got a Question or Problem?\nFeel free to chat on gitter and raise questions on Stack overflow using angular 2 formly tag. We also support questions or problems from the issues\n Found a Bug?\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can\nsubmit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Missing a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submission Guidelines\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using http://plnkr.co. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:\n\nversion of Angular used\n3rd-party libraries and their versions\nand most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduce scenario using http://plnkr.co/ allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem. If plunker is not a suitable way to demonstrate the problem (for example for issues related to our npm packaging), please create a standalone git repository demonstrating the problem.\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\nUnfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.\nYou can file new issues by filling out our new issue form.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n‼️‼️‼️  &#x1F449;Please follow commit message conventions\nDevelopment\n\nrun yarn\nrun npm run demo or yarn demo\nwrite tests & code in TS goodness :-)\nrun git add .\nrun npm run commit and follow the prompt (this ensures that your commit message follows our conventions).\npush your changes\ncreate a PR with a link to the original issue\nwait patiently :-)\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBC).\nFollow the existing styles (we have an .editorconfig file)\nDocument your changes in the README (try to follow the convention you see in the rest of the file)\nCreate an example for the website that demonstrates your changes so people can see how your changes work\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. We follow Angular project Commit Guidelines\n Contributing to community\n\nCreate plugins!\nWrite blog posts!\nRecord screencasts\nWrite examples. The website is driven by examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"dependencies.html":{"url":"dependencies.html","title":"package-dependencies - dependencies","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/animations : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/cdk : ^6.4.0\n        \n            @angular/common : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/core : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/forms : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/material : ^6.4.0\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser-dynamic : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @angular/router : ^6.0.9\n        \n            @ngx-loading-bar/router : ^2.1.1\n        \n            @progress/kendo-angular-dropdowns : ^2.1.0\n        \n            @progress/kendo-angular-inputs : ^3.0.0\n        \n            @progress/kendo-angular-intl : ^1.4.0\n        \n            @progress/kendo-angular-l10n : ^1.1.0\n        \n            @progress/kendo-theme-default : ^2.50.0\n        \n            bootstrap : ^4.1.2\n        \n            core-js : ^2.5.7\n        \n            ionic-angular : ^3.9.2\n        \n            nativescript-angular : ^6.0.6\n        \n            primeng : ^5.2.4\n        \n            rxjs : ^6.2.2\n        \n            rxjs-compat : ^6.2.2\n        \n            tns-core-modules : ^4.1.0\n        \n            tslib : ^1.9.2\n        \n            zone.js : ^0.8.26\n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\n\n@ngx-formly\n\n\n\nStatus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks:\n\n\nNgx Formly is a dynamic JSON powered form library for Angular (mainly based an on Angular Reactive Forms) that bring unmatched maintainability to your application's forms.\nSupported UI libs\n\n\n\nUI\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap\n✅\n\n\nIonic\n✅\n\n\nKendo\n✅\n\n\nMaterial2\n✅\n\n\nPrimeNG\n✅\n\n\nNativeScript\n✅\n\n\n\nWhich Version to use?\n\n\n\nAngular version\nFormly version\n\n\n\n\nAngular >= 6\n@ngx-formly/core@4.x\n\n\nAngular >= 5\n@ngx-formly/core@3.x\n\n\nAngular >= 4\n@ngx-formly/core@2.x\n\n\nAngular >= 2\n`ng-formly@1.x`\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\nDocumentation, demos, and guides\nStackBlitz Template\nUI Bootstrap\nUI Material\nUI Ionic\nUI PrimeNG\nUI Kendo\n\n\n\nQuick Start\nFollow these steps to get started with Ngx Formly. Also check out our demos for further examples.\n1. Install @angular/forms and @ngx-formly/core packages:\n  npm install @angular/forms @ngx-formly/core --save2. Choose and install your UI (pre-defined types/templates) package:\n\nMaterial2:\n\nEnsure you have already installed material2 https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started\nInstall @ngx-formly/materialnpm install @ngx-formly/material --save\n\n\nBootstrap:\n  npm install @ngx-formly/bootstrap --save\nIonic:\n  npm install @ngx-formly/ionic --save\nPrimeNG:\n  npm install @ngx-formly/primeng --save\nKendo:\n  npm install @ngx-formly/kendo --save\nNativeScript\n  npm install @ngx-formly/nativescript --save\n\n3. Import the FormlyModule and UI (pre-defined types/templates):\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {ReactiveFormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {FormlyModule} from '@ngx-formly/core';\nimport {FormlyBootstrapModule} from '@ngx-formly/bootstrap';\n\n// for material2 import `FormlyMaterialModule`:\n// import {FormlyMaterialModule} from '@ngx-formly/material';\n\n// for ionic import `FormlyIonicModule`:\n// import {FormlyIonicModule} from '@ngx-formly/ionic';\n\n// for primeng import `FormlyPrimeNGModule`:\n// import {FormlyPrimeNGModule} from '@ngx-formly/primeng';\n\n// for kendo import `FormlyKendoModule`:\n// import {FormlyKendoModule} from '@ngx-formly/kendo';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...,\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n    FormlyModule.forRoot(),\n    FormlyBootstrapModule,\n\n    // for material2:\n    // FormlyMaterialModule\n\n    // for ionic:\n    // FormlyIonicModule\n\n    // for primeng:\n    // FormlyPrimeNGModule\n\n    // for kendo:\n    // FormlyKendoModule\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}4. Define the form config in your component:\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FormGroup} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {FormlyFieldConfig} from '@ngx-formly/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  template: `\n    \n      \n        Submit\n      \n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  form = new FormGroup({});\n  model = { email: 'email@gmail.com' };\n  fields: FormlyFieldConfig[] = [{\n    key: 'email',\n    type: 'input',\n    templateOptions: {\n      type: 'email',\n      label: 'Email address',\n      placeholder: 'Enter email',\n      required: true,\n    }\n  }];\n\n  submit(model) {\n    console.log(model);\n  }\n}From there, it's just JavaScript. Allowing for DRY, maintainable, reusable forms.\nUsing with Angular-CLI\n@ngx-formly/schematics provides CLI commands for setting up a project and eventually generating other features (e.g. wrapper components).\nBuilt on top of Schematics, this tool integrates with the Angular CLI.\nInstallation\nInstall @ngx-formly/schematics from npm:\nnpm install @ngx-formly/schematics --save-dev\nDefault Schematics Collection\nTo use @ngx-formly/schematics as the default collection in your Angular CLI project,\nadd it to your angular.json:\nng config cli.defaultCollection @ngx-formly/schematicsThe collection schema defines the available schematics to run.\nThe @ngx-formly/schematics extend the default @schematics/angular collection and so all existing Angular CLI commands are available.\nIf you want to set defaults for schematics such as generating components with scss file, you must change the schematics package name from @schematics/angular to @ngx-formly/schematics in angular.json:\n\"schematics\": {\n  \"@ngx-formly/schematics:component\": {\n    \"styleext\": \"scss\"\n  }\n}Quick Start with Schematics\nInstall @angular/forms and @ngx-formly/core packages and choose a UI theme to install:\n  ng add @ngx-formly/schematics --ui-theme=materialRoadmap\nSee the issues labeled enhancement\nThanks\nA special thanks to Kent C.
